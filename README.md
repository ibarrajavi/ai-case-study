# Google DeepMind

## Overview and Origin

DeepMind was founded in 2010 by Demis Hassabis (CEO), Shane Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman. The London-based company was later acquired by Google in 2014. DeepMind was created with the goal of creating systems that could rationalize and learn like humans, combining machine learning, AI, and neuroscience.

The company received most of its early funding from venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Some notable investors were Founders Fund, Horizon Ventures, and Elon Musk. Eventually, it was bought by Google. Although the exact number is unknown, the acquisition reportedly was between $400 million and $650 million.

## Business Activities

>Google DeepMind's mission is "To solve intelligence, to advance science and benefit humanity.
"

DeepMind's intended customers would be other organizations. Currently, they don't offer any products of their own but use their AI tools/services within different organizations. Examples of this include General Motors & GE appliances.

DeepMind's access to Google's computing power and data puts them at a significant advantage over competitors. A big part of AI is the data sets in which they train their models.

Some of the technologies DeepMind uses include machine learning frameworks such as their TensorFlow library and PyTorch. They are also known for using reinforcement learning. DeepMind's AlphaGo was trained on reinforcement learning to play the game Go. The program beat the Go grandmaster, Lee Sedol, in 2016.

## Landscape

Google DeepMind is an artificial intelligence company focused on solving intelligence. Some major trends in this field have been the development of large language models, autonomous vehicles, virtual assistants, & even the application of AI in healthcare and finance. Some prominent figures in this field include OpenAI, Amazon, Tesla AI, Microsoft, Facebook (FAIR), & IBM. They have all done fantastic work in advancing the research of AI & ML.

## Results

The application of Google DeepMind's AI technology has had a significant impact, one being healthcare. DeepMind's AI can accurately diagnose patients, recommending them the best referrals. Using AlphaFold, the AI system can predict a protein structure, allowing them to advance biological research. In an interview with Lex Fridman, Demis Hassabis stated, "Every pharma company, every drug company executive I've spoken to has said their teams are using AlphaFold to accelerate the drugs they're trying to discover."

The accuracy of these tools is a core metric to measure success in AI. AlphaFold achieved a score of **92.4 out of 100** on the global distance test, which measures the similarity between two proteins. Efficiency is another major component; using AI DeepMind reduced Google's data center cooling bill by **40%.**

Relative to other companies, DeepMind is one of the leaders in AI. Their collaborations with key organizations have made this clear. They have some areas where they would need to improve, such as transparency and integrating their services within their products, but overall, they have done exceptionally well in the last few years.

## Recommendations

If I were to advise the company, I would suggest they offer a new chatbot to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Their previous chatbot, Bard, had some areas where it could improve. Since Bard would access the latest information via the internet, it would sometimes give the user the wrong answer. Using the knowledge and experience gained from Bard to improve, Google DeepMind could offer a revolutionary AI chatbot.

The implementation of this chatbot would increase user engagement throughout the company. Additionally, it could reduce costs in areas such as customer service due to its 24/7 availability. Its versatility would allow it to be tailored to fit specific business needs.

This service would mainly utilize deep reinforcement learning and transformers, Google's neural network architecture. Their model-free reinforcement learning is called Q-learning. TensorFlow library would provide the computational infrastructure. These technologies are the foundation for DeepMind chatbots, as reinforcement learning would enable their models to learn from trial and error. DeepMind must implement these tools so the chatbot can provide accurate information, be it a report, code, etc.
